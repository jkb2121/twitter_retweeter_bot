Twitter Retweeter Bot

This is a program that reads Twitter and selectively retweets stuff--in this case, a bot
that communicates information about local comedy shows.  I'm jamming different
technologies into the program to learn about Python and some new ways of doing things,
and also help out m brother's comedy...

...and make the world a better place.

Things I've messed with so far...
* Python
* Twitter API's
* Pyodbc
* MySQL
* Theading
* Objects
