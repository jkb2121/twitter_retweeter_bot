# Twitter Retweeter Bot

This is a program that reads Twitter and selectively retweets stuff--in this case, a bot
that communicates information about local comedy shows.  I'm jamming different
technologies into the program to learn about Python and some new ways of doing things,
and also help out my brother's comedy...

...and make the world a better place.

Things I've messed with so far for this project...
* Python
* Twitter API's
* Pyodbc
* MySQL
* Theading
* Objects
* YAML
* Pycharm
* Git
* pyunit tests

Things I'm going to get to (in various states of completion/incompletion on my desktop)
* Making the structure more "pythonic"
* Some type of monitor thread to show cumulative stats in the log
* Google Geoip API's
* Maybe even a Facebook API or two
* Database Stuff:
  * Move Blacklist from YAML to Database?
  * Move Watchers from YAML to the Database?
  * Move Hashtag from YAML to the Database?
* Capture Location Info (plus Longitude & Latitude)
* Comment better
* More / Better Unit tests
* Use Git properly (branches and merges)
* Debug Logging
* Add http://www.kr47.net/piechart.php to Github somewhere (that shows the live Twitter Retweeter Bot Data)


Disclaimer:  Yeah, maybe this code kind of sucks and I was lazy and didn't really
comment as much as I should have, and definitely didn't start with test-driven development
and am learning about Git in real-time, so please pardon its ugliness. :)
