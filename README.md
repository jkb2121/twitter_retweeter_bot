# Twitter Retweeter Bot

This is a program that reads Twitter and selectively retweets stuff--in this case, a bot
that communicates information about local comedy shows.  I'm jamming different
technologies into the program to learn about Python and some new ways of doing things,
and also help out my brother's comedy...

...and make the world a better place.

Things I've messed with so far for this project...
* Python
* Twitter API's
* Pyodbc
* MySQL
* Theading
* Objects
* YAML
* Pycharm
* Git

Things I'm going to get to (in various states of completion/incompletion on my desktop)
* Making the structure more "pythonic"
* pyunit tests
* Google Geoip API's
* Maybe even a Facebook API or two
